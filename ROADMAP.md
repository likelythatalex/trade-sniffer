# ROADMAP

**Single source of truth for the prioritized backlog** — what to build next, in what order,
and its current status. v1 has shipped (scheduled scanner, HTML dashboard, Discord notify,
516-ticker universe, gh-pages publishing).

This file owns *priority, sequencing, and status*. It does **not** duplicate design detail:

| For this, look here | |
|---|---|
| Design rationale for a future feature | `SPEC.md` §12 (Future phases) |
| How a *concept* is implemented today + its status | `docs/appendix.md` |
| VSA signal definitions / thresholds to calibrate | `docs/wyckoff_methodology.md` |

When an item below is built, flip its status here **and** update the matching `appendix.md`
entry in the same change (per the CLAUDE.md definition-of-done). New ideas that don't fit an
existing SPEC §12 entry get added here first; promote to SPEC only if they need real design.

Status: `TODO` (not started) · `IN PROGRESS` · `DONE` · `BLOCKED`. Items are listed in
recommended execution order within each tier.

---

## Tier 1 — Operational & correctness (near-term, cheap, high ROI)

Small fixes that tighten how the live scanner runs. These are mostly *new* todos not covered
elsewhere, so their detail lives here.

| Item | Status | Notes / detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Batch fetching** (`yf.download` multi-symbol) | DONE | `data.fetch_many` does one threaded batch (OHLCV + splits via `actions=True`); cache hits skip the network, misses are downloaded. Exchange is now resolved lazily (`resolve_exchange`) only for flagged tickers, not all 516. |
| **Drop the partial in-session bar** | DONE | `data._drop_incomplete_last_bar` drops the trailing bar when its period hasn't closed (conservative 21:00-UTC cutoff, no tzdata dep). Off-schedule runs stay no-lookahead. (The strategy-level bar-N/bar-N+1 acceptance test already exists — `test_no_lookahead_evaluation_unaffected_by_future_bars`.) |
| **`index.html` landing page on gh-pages** | DONE | `report.write_index_page` writes `output/index.html` linking `latest_daily.html` + `latest_weekly.html`; written every run so the bare Pages URL resolves. |
| **Investigate the ~9 skipped tickers** | DONE | Investigated: **not** symbol mismatches — all 10 are data-quality exclusions of *real* large moves (CNC −40% earnings, WBD +29% M&A, CHRW/EXPD earnings, EA merger-arb ATR compression). Skip/error reasons now surfaced in the run summary (consolidated log) + on the dashboard. Follow-on below. |
| **Tune data-quality to not exclude real moves** | DONE | Added a volume discriminator (`real_move_volume_mult`): a large range/gap bar on ≥ N× trailing-median volume is a real move (earnings/M&A), exempt from the spike/split exclusions — glitches don't come with real volume. Full-universe skips dropped **10 → 0** (real moves now scored). SPEC §5.2. |

## Tier 2 — Sharpen the signal (finish the PARTIAL pieces)

Completes scoring inputs that currently **abstain**, so composite scores discriminate better.
Detail/status per concept lives in `appendix.md`; definitions in `wyckoff_methodology.md`.

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **RS-vs-SPY confirmation** | DONE | SPY batch-fetched per timeframe (`scanner._benchmark_close`), passed via `StrategyContext.benchmark_close`; `wyckoff._relative_strength` scores stock-minus-SPY return over `trend_lookback`, logged as `rs_vs_spy`. Fixed a tz-index mismatch between the two fetch paths in `_normalize_columns`. SPEC §7.1. |
| **Volatility contraction ("the coil")** | DONE | `wyckoff.score_vol_contraction` compares recent bar-range vs earlier in the range (`vol_contraction_window` tunable); direction from range location. Feeds `confirmation`, logged as `vol_contraction`. SPEC §7.2. |
| **Complete spring/upthrust** | DONE | Break+snapback is the gate; magnitude scales from `SPRING_BASE_FRACTION` to full via rejection wick (`spring_wick_pct`) + above-median volume on the false-break bar. SPEC §6.3. |
| **Climax reaction check** | DONE | `wyckoff._score_climax` now requires a volume spike at an extreme **and** a subsequent ≥ `climax_reaction_atr` × ATR reaction; a bare spike abstains. SPEC §6.2; methodology §2.3. (`volume_pctile` alternative still deferred.) |
| **Calendar-based missing-bar detection** | DONE | `pandas-market-calendars` (NYSE); `data.py` computes expected sessions (once per batch) and passes them into the pure `data_quality.clean`, which flags missing sessions, forward-fills one isolated bar, and measures completeness vs the calendar (daily). SPEC §5.2. |

## Tier 3 — Validation & calibration (does the score actually work?)

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Backtesting harness** | DONE (Phase 1: replay) | `src/backtest/` (own CLI, off the cron path). Re-scores history with the production pipeline as-of each bar, computes forward + excess-vs-SPY returns, and reports IC / by-bucket returns / hit-rate lift / per-sub-score IC. **Replay carries survivorship bias** (caveated in every report); MTF not replayed. Phase 2 (unbiased) = run the same `outcomes`/`metrics` over accumulated live `signals.csv` once it grows. SPEC §12. |
| **Calibrate seed thresholds & weights** | TODO (unblocked) | Tune the `[TUNABLE]` params using the backtester's IC / sub-score-IC / bucket monotonicity. appendix §D lists every tunable; methodology has the `[VERIFY]`/`[TUNABLE]` stubs. Best done once more live data accrues (replay is biased). |
| **Failed→revived event study (MFE)** | TODO (data-gated) | Path-dependent question: did setups that *failed then re-qualified* eventually fulfil? Needs an MFE / time-to-target outcome metric — fixed-horizon IC can't see a dip-then-trigger. **Reconstructable offline from existing `transition` + `run_ts`; no schema change.** Separate analysis from the core IC harness. Don't condition the core backtest on `transition` (selection bias). |

## Tier 4 — Outputs & UX

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Lightweight Charts annotations** | DONE | Dashboard rebuilt as a single shared annotated chart + ranked candidate list, using TradingView's open-source Lightweight Charts™ fed by OHLCV embedded in the page (no view-time data fetch). Annotations: range high/low band + spring/upthrust marker. Keeps an "open in TradingView" link + attribution. Superseded the display-only embed widget. SPEC §8.1, §12. |
| **Agent reviewer** | DONE (v1: bounded) | `src/review.py` — proactive, objective due-diligence pass on NEWLY-flagged setups, precomputed at scan time (Anthropic REST via `requests`, no SDK dep), baked into the dashboard. Strategy-agnostic (consumes the card contract), fail-soft, framed as review-aid-not-advice. Cost controls: off by default, NEW-only, per-run cap, cheap model, bounded output, cached by `timeframe:ticker`. Future: tool-using (deeper) agency. SPEC §8.5. |
| **Discord static chart PNG preview** | TODO | Glanceable image attached to the notification (the dashboard stays the inspection surface). SPEC §12. |
| **Dashboard: toggle to view recently failed setups** | TODO | Review/reflect affordance — show recently *invalidated* setups, not just current qualifiers. Scanner already classifies `failed`; surface those cards behind a UI toggle. Optionally feed the reviewer the setup's `transition`/episode history so a re-flagged setup is reviewed in context (the agent currently sees only the as-of snapshot). |

## Active build — Trade layer (planner + local journal)

The current focus. A second seam parallel to `Strategy` (signal-agnostic): turn a signal into
an actionable but **never-executed** plan, journal the trades you'd take (locally/privately),
and reflect on closed ones. Design + decisions: **SPEC §8A**. Loop: `signal → plan → journal
→ outcome → reflect`. Built incrementally, each step tested + green before the next.

| Step | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Disclaimer + privacy scaffolding | DONE | README + dashboard-footer disclaimer; `.gitignore` covers the private journal so trades can never leak to the public repo/gh-pages. |
| 1. Formalize `StrategyResult.levels` | DONE | Typed `Levels` (range high/low + spring_low/upthrust_high false-break extremes) on `StrategyResult`; wyckoff populates the *facts*, the combiner propagates the direction-driving strategy's levels onto the composite, the planner derives entry/stop/target from them. Facts-in-strategy / policy-in-planner keeps the planner strategy-agnostic. |
| 2. `trade_plan.py` (pure, public) | DONE | `TradePlan` + `plan_trade(direction, levels, cfg)`: entry (confirmation break), stop (structural + % buffer), target (measured move), sizing (account-risk %, 1%/$100k notional), management playbook (BE@+1R, scale 50% @ target, trail N×ATR). Flat `trade_plan:` config block + fail-fast validation; abstains (`None`) on degenerate setups. `[TUNABLE]` seeds. SPEC §8A.1. |
| 3. Dashboard render of the plan | TODO | Plan on each card + entry/stop/target as price lines on the existing chart. Public (no personal data). |
| 4. `journal.py` + CLI (PRIVATE) | TODO | Local-only, gitignored, never in CI. Record intended trades (`python -m src.journal add …`). |
| 5. Journal auto-outcome | TODO | Reuse `outcomes.py`: which level hit first, realized R, MFE/MAE. The real-trade dataset. |
| 6. Post-trade agent review (PRIVATE) | TODO | Reuse the `Reviewer` ABC with a reflection prompt; runs locally; sends trade detail to the API from your machine only. |

## Tier 5 — Future phases & architecture

Bigger directions, all with design rationale in **SPEC §12** — see there for the "why". Listed
here only for visibility/sequencing.

| Item | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Additional strategies (momentum / RS / volatility) | TODO | Each = new file in `strategies/` + config line. SPEC §6, §12. |
| Confirmation stacking | TODO | Combiner raises conviction when independent strategies agree. SPEC §12. |
| Correlation-awareness in `combiner.py` | TODO | Down-weight correlated strategy clusters (why per-strategy scores are logged). SPEC §12; appendix "Signal Correlation Awareness" (FUTURE). |
| Crypto mode | TODO | Separate profile (24/7, crypto RS benchmark, crypto symbols/liquidity). Same phase as multi-strategy. SPEC §12. |
| Telegram notification channel | TODO | Behind the existing `notify.py` interface. SPEC §8.3, §12. |
| Regime-aware feature baselines | TODO | e.g. reset volatility baseline after earnings expansion. SPEC §12. |
| Climax-anchored range boundaries | TODO | Refinement over the v1 support/resistance band. SPEC §12; methodology §2.3/§3. |
| Paid data source (Polygon) | TODO | If intraday / higher quality is ever needed. SPEC §12. |
| IBKR optional output | TODO | For users keeping TWS running. SPEC §12. |
| Hosted multi-tool dashboard / orchestrator | TODO (trigger-based) | Today the static gh-pages + GitHub Actions model *is* the orchestrator. Revisit a small web app + scheduler (and maybe a DB / VPS) when a **view-time backend** is needed (in-browser agent, on-demand re-scan, filtering), **intraday scheduling**, a **real DB** (signals outgrow CSV+partitioning), or **heavy/long compute** (big backtests). Pure functions + per-concern CLIs + the `Strategy` interface make this a packaging change, not a rewrite — worth a focused planning session when a trigger fires. |
